    <p>Game doesn't have enough variety to incentivise playing it over and over and over. The builds you can build aren't super crazy and there's so few that you can with like 50% success rate go into a run with like 3 build ideas and be able to get one of them. The desire for replayability then comes from wanting to see where the story goes which stopped being a driving force when persephone fobbed me off for the 10th time in a row after giving me like a sentence. Heat system is a cool way of balancing the roguelite elements by essentially stripping them one by one, but the game being harder each run isn't real variety. Art style is sick, even though it was hindered by switch handheld mode, character designs were consistently amazing, same with the music I'll go indie game fan mode and say big ups my man Darren Korb. Writing is fun most of the time, and the story remained interesting for a good bit, but idk beating mum's heart 10 times to unlock the rest of the game wasn't super fun game design in isaac, and doing the same to just end the game feels even worse. Idk for the most part the game didn't hit that beautiful roguelike stimulation in my head</p>
