    <p>I love when I'm playing a game and I go ooooohhhhhh that's so sick. Pikmin 4 had quite a few of those moments, mgs2 probably the only one to beat it out in that category this year. The tide going out at midday on the beach map, the night missions even if the execution of it throughout the game fell short of it's potential, dandori?????? come on dandori yes dude. My brother never really cared to play pikmin versus with me so I'd never played it before, now with dandori I don't need real people, I can have beautiful dandori forever and it's so nice. I think I would've gone for platinum on all dandori if I knew that the reset button existed, grinded through the first wise leaf's tower of dandori challenge with no reset button, exclaiming often that it's such dogshit game design to not have a reset button and to have to wait 5 minutes for another shot, only to discover watching a youtuber play that yeah. The older pikmin in this game unfortunately do look very 3d model with lighting rather than little guy the same way the newer pikmin do which is a bit of a shame. Pikmin team do need to dream more critters up, ik it's a cave game so you need a bunch of bosses => use old bosses, it makes sense, and I do pog up a little when I see a guy, but every extra time I see them it's less and less cool, you can only do emperor bulblax so many times and they've done it that many and more in pikmin 4. There were not enough new guys, it's not quite fit them on two hands but it's real close especially if we exclude variations on an enemy. Watermelon spiky elephants on high places brilliant enemy, would love 15 more like him, pikmin 1 was so fun in good part due to the joy of discovery and exploring an unfamiliar world and learning, pikmin 4 I stroll around and see a guy from pikmin 2 next to a guy from pikmin 1 next to a guy from pikmin 3 please shigeru miyamoto, move houses so you don't just see the same old bugs and in your dementia riddled brain think you're inventing the bulborb for the 5th time. Also oatchi, oatchi Oatchi</p>
