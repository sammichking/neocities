    <p>Incredibly captivating and addicting, unfortunately I was only smart enough to go halfway down the rabbit hole, I beat the game obviously, and I was in the underground area trying to decipher symbols, I found the hideout where they hid when they stole the crown jewels, but I reached my puzzle solving limit and got frustrated with the randomness when trying to find a specific room. For the most part the game's post game mystery was accessible and intriguing, like tunic's post game thing I couldn't do straight away, at least in this one I was allowed to have fun for quite a while after beating it</p>
