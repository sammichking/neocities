    <p>I think this game suffers most from the fact that at the time I started playing it my autism points were largely depleted by binding of isaac and gungeon. I think in a different world I could've gotten more into it, like the gameplay is probably the most fun of all the major roguelikes, like most are run in a circle dodging projectiles and firing at them, which is all well and good when you've got other stuff going on in the game, and gungeon in particular really nails it with the increased bullet hell and dodge roll. The combat of necrodancer is very tactile and crunchy, like the you hitting enemy sound is so nice and you're a lot more involved with the movement since you have to time everything all time, the combat really does feel like a dance with the enemies. Because it's such a fun and unique system they have set up they get to have a bunch of fun bosses with cool ideas, the konga line boss with the missing beat sick, the chess boss is a little bit messy but it's such a fun idea that I can't hate, the octopus boss with all the musical instruments was fun too. And while I'm in my things I like bag, the music is also great and idc it was always sick having the shopkeeper's voice come in, both musically and also really fun idea to have him fade in so that you can find him by sound. I think maybe in my mind I've been too harsh on this game, I think I thrust expectations of an isaac type game upon it just because it was an indie dungeoncrawling roguelike from the early to mid 2010s. Though there are characters and items to unlock, it's not on that same scale, and instead of the run variety being like 25% determined by character and 75% items, the balance is much more character focused, there are very few passive items, and the ones that do exist are often just variations on like 7 different types of gear, and while the type of gear does change how you play the game it doesn't quite do it for me. Is it an insane statement to say that the game is carried by having great fundamental gameplay? Maybe I'm just irked that it isn't isaac but there's not quite enough going on in the game for me to fall in love.</p>
