    <!-- here's a comment y'all -->
    <p>I am trying to learn java and css! I am learning from <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations">The Odin Project</a> atm</p>
    <p>Here is a list of some of my favourite things</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Music</li>
        <li>Video games</li>
        <li>Smiling</li>
        <li>I like manga but don't really have the brain for tv episodes</li>
        <li>I like movies, that's just one video, multiple videos of same thing in a row is where it gets tricky for me</li>
        <li>I'm forgetting things...</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Here's a list of my top 5 favourite numbers</p>
    <ol>
        <li>51, the goat bro wow, from the day I first learnt of 17*3=51 I've been in awe, hasn't been beaten </li>
        <li>7, I think this place is somewhat shaky as 7 doesn't make me feel whole but it is a great number truly</li>
        <li>44, an old favourite of mine that I've grown off of a little but I'll include because of impact on me</li>
        <li>10, tbh on it's own 10 is only "good" but what it gets up to and all its children are something to be in awe of, there is no 100 without 10</li>
        <li>9, 9 I'm a little untrustworthy of because it's kind of mean but there's a little bit of a slickness to 9 that you have to respect</li>
        
    </ol>

    </div>
    

    <p>Here's how to make a list:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>First thing</li>
      <li>Second thing</li>
      <li>Third thing</li>
    </ul>
